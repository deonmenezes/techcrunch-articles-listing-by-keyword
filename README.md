# Lyrna

Latest **tech, science & learning news** — **with images**,
aggregated locally from multiple outlets and made browsable **by keyword and
source**. Type a keyword (e.g. `AI`, `funding`, `OpenAI`), pick a source, or
click any tag to filter; thumbnails and headlines link back to the original
article.

## Sources

| Source | Region | How it's pulled |
|---|---|---|
| **TechCrunch** | SF Bay Area | WordPress REST API |
| **SiliconValley.com** | Silicon Valley | WordPress REST API |
| **Wired** | San Francisco | RSS (media images) |
| **The Verge** | National | Atom (content images) |
| **Ars Technica** | National | RSS (media images) |

Every article is normalised and **fully labelled**: `source`, `source_id`,
`region`, `focus`, `content_type` (`article`/`video`/`podcast`), a stable `id`,
plus title, link, author, published (ISO-8601), image, thumbnail, section,
categories (keywords) and summary.

## How it works — local aggregation, no Apify / no hosted service

WordPress outlets are pulled from their REST API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`,
`_fields`-trimmed) so each post is tiny and arrives **with its featured image**,
keyword slugs, author and excerpt. RSS/Atom outlets are parsed directly with
image extraction (`media:content`, `media:thumbnail`, `enclosure`, or the first
`<img>` in the content). No third-party scraping platform, no API keys.

- **`lib/feeds.js`** — shared multi-source collector (WordPress + RSS/Atom),
  dedup + newest-first, used by both API routes.
- **`api/articles.js`** — Vercel Function: aggregated JSON with filtering
  (`q`, `keyword`, `source`, `region`, `section`), paging, open CORS. Edge-cached 10 min.
- **`api/keywords.js`** — source / region / section / keyword tallies for filter UIs.
- **`index.html`** — single-file front end: lazy-loaded thumbnails, keyword
  search, source filter, top-keywords cloud, video badges. No build step.
- **`scrape.py`** — local scraper (stdlib only) mirroring the same sources and
  labels; writes `articles.json`. The article `id` hash matches the JS exactly,
  so snapshot and live data are interchangeable.
- **`articles.json`** — pre-scraped snapshot (all sources, all with images)
  bundled in so the site works instantly and offline.

The page calls `/api/articles` first for live data and falls back to the bundled
snapshot.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 scrape.py            # refresh articles.json across all sources (with images)
python3 -m http.server       # serve at http://localhost:8000  (snapshot only)
# or, for the live API:
vercel dev                   # http://localhost:3000  (with /api/articles)
```

## Mobile API

A small open JSON API powers the site and is ready for native apps (iOS/Android):

- `GET /api/articles` — newest articles with images; supports `q`, `keyword`,
  `source`, `region`, `section`, `limit`, `page`/`offset`. CORS open, edge-cached.
- `GET /api/keywords` — source / region / section / keyword tallies for a filter UI.

See **[API.md](API.md)** for the full reference plus a copy-paste **Swift
`Codable` + SwiftUI** example.

## Product analytics

Privacy-gated, aggregate product analytics is available through the existing Vercel host and is disabled by default. See **[ANALYTICS.md](ANALYTICS.md)** for setup, the event dictionary, consent behavior, verification, suggested reports, and session-duration interpretation. Run `npm test` to validate the event/property privacy allowlist.

## Research topics

Lyrna provides 23 exact research-topic feeds backed by OpenAlex and enforced by a server-side rolling two-year freshness gate. Topic cards are labeled as research papers and identify the indexed journal/publisher. PubMed/PMC-identified papers can be checked against Europe PMC and rendered only after an exact supported open license is verified server-side; all other records remain abstract/summary plus source link. See **[DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md)** for the complete frontend-to-provider path, query mappings, exclusions, freshness semantics, limitations, environment variables, and verification steps.

## Deploy

Pushed to GitHub and deployed on Vercel (git-connected — every push auto-deploys).
To redeploy manually:

```bash
vercel --prod
```
